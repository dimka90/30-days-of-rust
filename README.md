# 🦀 Rust Practice Workspace

Welcome to my **Rust learning repository** — a personal workspace where I practice and experiment with core Rust concepts, from basic syntax to advanced memory management and concurrency.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains folders for different topics and practice sessions.  
Each directory focuses on a specific Rust concept, daily exercise, or project.

### 🗂 Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Day1**, **Day2**, **Day3**, **Day4**, **Day5** | Daily Rust learning sessions covering syntax, ownership, borrowing, and structs. |
| **Closure/** | Practice with closures and functional programming in Rust. |
| **Cryptograpy/wallet/src/types** | Experiments with cryptography and type definitions for wallet-like systems. |
| **Drop/** | Understanding the `Drop` trait and resource cleanup. |
| **Errors/** | Handling and propagating errors using `Result` and `Option`. |
| **HashMaps/** | Practice with Rust's `HashMap` for key-value storage. |
| **LamdaFunction/** | Higher-order functions and lambda (closure) examples. |
| **ReferenceCounting/** | Working with smart pointers like `Rc` and `Arc`. |
| **SmartPointer/** | Exploring ownership with `Box`, `Rc`, and `RefCell`. |
| **String/stringCount/** | String manipulation and counting examples. |
| **Threads/** | Concurrency and multithreading exercises. |

## ⚙️ Running the Code

Each folder is a standalone example or Cargo project.  
To run any example:

```bash
cd FolderName
cargo run
```
## For example
```
cd Day3
cargo run
```
### 🧠 Topics Covered

## 💡 Purpose

This repo serves as a learning journal for Rust programming.
It’s meant to:

- Track my progress while learning Rust.

- Serve as a quick reference for future projects.

- Provide hands-on examples for revisiting core concepts
## 🧰 Requirements

Rust (latest stable version)
Install using rustup
:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
## 🦀 Notes

This repository is for personal study and experimentation.
Feel free to explore, fork, and learn from the examples.

"Learning Rust is not about memorizing syntax — it’s about understanding ownership, safety, and control."
