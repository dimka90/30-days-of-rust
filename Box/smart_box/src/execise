Exercise 1: Create a Basic Linked List
Create an enum List with two variants:

Cons(i32, Box<List>): holds a value of type i32 and a pointer to the next list.

Nil: represents the end of the list.

Create a linked list with the following structure:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> Nil

Write a function that traverses the list and prints each value.
